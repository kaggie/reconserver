    "# Programmatic Interaction with Recon Server\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to interact with the `server_app.py` programmatically using the `ReconClientApp` class from `client_app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "1.  The Recon server (`server_app.py`) should be running.\n",
    "2.  A `recon.opts` file must be configured in the root directory of this project, with at least the `SERVER_HOSTNAME`, `SERVER_PORT`, and `SHARED_KEY` correctly set to match the server's configuration. The `SHARED_KEY` must be identical to the one used by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key operations covered:**\n",
    "*   Setting up dummy input files.\n",
    "*   Initializing the `ReconClientApp`.\n",
    "*   Connecting to and disconnecting from the server.\n",
    "*   Submitting a reconstruction job.\n",
    "*   Querying the server's status.\n",
    "*   Viewing the current job queue on the server."

    "## 5. Result Handling (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReconClientApp` methods demonstrated above (`submit_recon_job`, `get_server_status`, `get_queue_details`) are for specific, targeted interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a full job cycle including the download of results, the `client_app.py` script uses a method like `run_full_job_cycle` (which internally calls `submit_recon_job` and then `process_job_and_get_results`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_job_and_get_results(job_id)` method would typically:\n",
    "1.  Listen for server messages related to the given `job_id`.\n",
    "2.  Handle `dicom_transfer_start` commands by acknowledging readiness.\n",
    "3.  Receive files sent by the server (e.g., DICOMs) using its internal `SecureFileTransferClient.receive_data()` method, saving them to the directory specified by `CLIENT_DOWNLOAD_DIR` in `recon.opts`.\n",
    "4.  Wait for a `recon_complete` or `job_failed` message from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this full cycle programmatically using the refactored client, you would call `client.run_full_job_cycle(files_to_process, recon_options)` or sequentially use `connect()`, `submit_recon_job()`, `process_job_and_get_results()`, and `disconnect()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of how one might use `process_job_and_get_results` (after submitting a job and getting a `job_id`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assuming client is connected and job_id was obtained from submit_recon_job\n",
    "# if job_id:\n",
    "#     print(f\"Waiting for job {job_id} to complete and receive results...\")\n",
    "#     if client.process_job_and_get_results(job_id):\n",
    "#         print(f\"Job {job_id} completed and results (if any) should be in '{client.client_download_dir}'.\")\n",
    "#     else:\n",
    "#         print(f\"Job {job_id} failed or results could not be processed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Running the cell above would require the server to actually process the job and send back results, which depends on the server's `RECON_SCRIPT_PATH` being functional for the dummy files."

    "\n",
    "This notebook has shown how to use the refactored `ReconClientApp` to programmatically connect to the Recon server, submit jobs, and query server/queue status. For more complex interactions or full job cycles including result downloads, the `run_full_job_cycle` method or a combination of the demonstrated methods can be used."
